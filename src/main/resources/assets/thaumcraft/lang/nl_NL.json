It is a simple matter to turn kinetic energy into power and creating kinetic energy with vis is thaumaturgy 101. Using vis to turn an axle connected to a dynamo did not work as some magical energy would transmit through the axle and cause all kinds of problems.<BR>In the end I designed a special linkage using magnets and some clever engineering. This linkage would transmit the kinetic energy while not allowing the vis and mundage energy to interfere with each other.<BR>Unfortunately the nature of the linkage places some limits on the power that can be generated as some kinetic energy is lost. The generator can only generate 10 FE/RF per tick. It draws vis directly from the aura to do this and a single point produces enough energy for 5 seconds of operation (1000 FE/RF).<BR>A redstone signal will disable the generator.",

The old scrolls aren't very clear on how to go about this, so I will need to find my own way.<BR>I have played with the idea of assembling a focus from crystals and then using vis to bind them together. My initial experiments have been failures... explosive failures.<BR>I think the answer I seek lies with an alchemical process.<BR>Using an ordo crystal as a core I might be able to leverage its ordered structure to grow a focus around it. While this is happening it should absorb praecantatio and auram essentia.<BR>The result should hopefully be a crystal focus able to absorb and manipulate vis. ",
  "research.BASEAUROMANCY.stage.2": "Using Alchemy to create the focus was indeed the path to success. The focus is stable and clear - now I simply need to imprint the proper patterns into it. For this I will need a Focal Manipulator<BR>I have already drawn up plans for a Focal Manipulator. The way it functions is similar to an arcane workbench in many ways, but instead of using vis to craft items it instead imprints patterns into the focus crystal.<BR>I must also design the patterns that I will need to imprint. I have and idea for a pattern to create flame, but I need to do some more research.",

All I need to do is craft my first focus.<BR>By arranging specially prepared vis crystals around the blank focus I can set up patterns that will determine what function the focus will perform.

The empty node below it is marked with both a target and a trajectory icon. Mediums (like §nTouch§0) require trajectories to determine what they effect - the §nRoot§0 node provides a trajectory that matches where the caster is looking so by linking §nTouch§0 to it I will be able to 'touch' anything I am looking at. Mediums almost always provide a target (in this case whatever has been 'touched') and some can also provide a trajectory. In this case though I require a target so I will be able to link the §nFire§0 effect.<BR>By linking §nRoot§0, §nTouch§0 and §nFire§0 in this way I will be able to create a focus that applies the §nFire§0 effect to whatever I touch.<BR>I could in theory link §nFire§0 directly to §nRoot§0, but since root provides the caster as a target that means I will simply set myself on fire.<BR>I can fine tune exactly what the §nFire§0 effect does by tweaking its damage and burn duration in the bottom right of the interface. Many patterns will allow me to fine tune them in this way.<BR>Creating a focus require three types of resources - the first is the crystals used in the crafting process, the second is vis from the aura, and lastly it also requires some player experience. Every time a focus is used it will also consume a small amount of vis from the aura.<PAGE>§nComplexity§0<BR>The effects I can create now are fairly simple and limited. There is a limit to how many patterns I can attach to a focus. This is measured as the focus Complexity. Each pattern type has a complexity cost and increasing their paramaters (for example the damage of a fire pattern) will increase the complexity further. Using a pattern more than once also incurs a stacking complexity cost increase of 50%.<BR>The complexity of a focus directly determines how much vis it will cost to cast and how long the caster gauntlet needs to cooldown between casts.",

  "research.MINDBIOTHAUMIC.stage.2": "Though hesitant at first, I soon overcame any trepidation I felt and delved into Biothaumaturgy - merging flesh, machines and magic into a single whole.<BR>The results are encouraging and I am now able to infuse clockwork minds with salvaged gray matter to form a mind with much greater capabilities.<BR>This has also allowed me to create more complex versions of seals I already know.<BR>Another advantage if this mind is that it will allow a golem to learn. As it completes tasks it will gain experience and rank up. Higher ranks grants a golem additional health, speed and damage.<BR>Golems start at rank 0 and can improve up to rank 10.<BR>Golems will retain their rank if picked up.",
